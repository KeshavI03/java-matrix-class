# java-matrix-class
Improved AP CS project to create a Matrix class with basic functionality

Constructors:

  Empty 1x1 Matrix
  
  Empty NxM Matrix
  
  NxM Matrix w/ Integer values between 0 and range
  
  Matrix filled from NxM array
  
  Matrix copy constructor
  
  
Methods:

  length - returns Matrix length
  
  height - returns Matrix height
  
  Add - Adds passed Double to each element of Matrix
  
  Add - Adds each element of passed Matrix to corresponding elements of current class
  
  Add - Adds each element of passed NxM Array to corresponding elements of current class
  
  3 Subtract Classes perform the same operations as Add, but Subtract corresponding values
  
  Scalar Multiply - Multiplies each element of Matrix by passed Double
  
  Scalar Multiply - Multiplies each element of Matrix by the corresponding element of passed array
  
  Scalar Multiply - Multiplies each element of Matrix by the corresponding element of passed Matrix
  
  Multiply - Proper Matrix Multiplication of NxM and MxP Matrix w/ resulting Matrix being size NxP
  
  Transpose - Returns filled MxN Matrix given current class Matrix is of size NxM
  
  Get Array - Returns new array with copied data from the class array (New Array created instead of reference)
  
  Get Element - Returns element at position x,y from NxM Matrix given that x<=N and y<=M
  
  To String - Returns relatively formated string representation of Matrix
